# Content_Based_Filtering_Recommender_System

### Project's Title: Content-Based Filtering Recommender System


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
- We will implement the content-based filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.

- The goal of a content-based filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors:
    * Recognizes there may be other information available about the user and/or movie that may improve the prediction. 
    * The additional information is provided to a neural network which then generates the user's and movie's vector.

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Recommendation_Engine" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Section "Importing modules".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Movie ratings dataset" Section for the corresponding part of a project to get the previously mentioned project goals due to the Content-Based Filtering Recommender System model execution.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
